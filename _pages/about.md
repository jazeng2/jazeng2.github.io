About me
------

Hi! My name is Jinghan (Annie) Zeng, and I am an undergraduate studying Computer Science and Mathematics at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. I am currently set to graduate in Spring 2026.

I am fortunante to be under the advisement of [Chandra Chekuri](https://chekuri.cs.illinois.edu/) and [Ruta Mehta](https://rutamehta.cs.illinois.edu/) as part of the [CS STARS](https://siebelschool.illinois.edu/broadening-participation-computing/programs/csambassadors) program. I am also mentored by [Abhishek Methuku](https://sites.google.com/view/abhishekmethuku/home) as part of the ICLUE program.

My research interests lie at the intersection of combinatorics and theoretical computer science, spanning topics in graph theory, extremal combinatorics, graph algorithms, and game theory. I am interested in understanding the mathematical properties of graphs, and applying that knowledge to problems in theoretical computer science. 

You can reach me at [jazeng2@illinois.edu](jazeng2@illinois.edu). 

My CV can be found [here](https://jazeng2.github.io/files/cv.pdf) (Last Updated: May 27, 2025).
